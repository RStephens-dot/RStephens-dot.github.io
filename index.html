Wreaths Across America</h1>

<h2>The Ceremony</h2>
<p>On Dec. 15, 2024, visitors at Fort Reno Cemetery put Christmas wreaths next to the tombstomes of deceased American veterans as part of a nationwide program hosted by the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR).</p>

<h2>Program</h2>
<p>Leslie Dietrich and Grace Ellsworth, both members of DAR, provided an introduction and purpose of the event. Their purpose is <em>not to decorate graves</em> but express a "symbol of honor for veterans' sacriface."  An Honor Guard posted and retired the U.S. and other flags.  Taps was played, then Christmas Guns were fired.</p>
