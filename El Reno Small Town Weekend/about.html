<blockquote>
<p>“A Small Town Weekend,” El Reno’s 27th car-centric festival between June 6 - 8, 2025, will have you ready to roll into summer with three days of fun.  All events except the cruises and live bands take place at Adams Park, 2001 Park Drive (between Sunset Ave. and Country Club Road) and attendance is free to watch the events.</p>
	
<p>Things kick-off on Friday, June 6, with an all-day swap meet (8:00 a.m. – dark), city-wide cruise at 5:00 p.m. (open to everyone with a vehicle), a children’s Power Wheels race (6:00 p.m.) and live bands at Centre Theater, 110 S. Bickford Ave. (7:00 p.m.).</p>  

<p>On Saturday, there's a Hot Wheels competition for children (9:00 a.m.), car show (8:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m), Burn Out competition (12:00 p.m.) and a town-wide, leisurely, four-mile cruise between 7:00 – 9:00 p.m. on Route 66.</p>  

<p>Sunday, June 8, ends the weekend events with drag racing on Sunset Blvd. between 1:00 – 4 p.m.  New and old cars race each other on a 1/8th mile strip for bragging rights.</p>     

<p><strong>All proceeds from A Small Town Weekend are donated to local charities.</strong>.  There will be plenty of food and beverage trucks.</p>
